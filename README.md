# Hi, I'm Xianke Qiang (强贤柯) 👋

I received my B.Eng. degree from China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao, China, in 2023. Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s and PhD's degree at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. My research interests include federated learning, split learning, vehicular networks, AIGC, resource allocation, the Internet of Things, and more.

## 📚 Publications

Here are some of my recent publications:
- **[Split Federated Learning Empowered Vehicular Edge Intelligence: Adaptive Parellel Design and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15804)**, arxiv, Jun 2024.
  - *To realize ubiquitous intelligence of future vehicular networks, artificial intelligence (AI) is critical since it can mine knowledge from vehicular data to improve the quality of many AI driven vehicular services. By combining AI techniques with vehicular networks, Vehicular Edge Intelligence (VEI) can utilize the computing, storage, and communication resources of vehicles to train the AI models. Nevertheless, when executing the model training, the traditional centralized learning paradigm requires vehicles to upload their raw data to a central server, which results in significant communication overheads and the risk of privacy leakage. In this article, we first overview the system architectures, performance metrics and challenges ahead of VEI design. Then we propose to utilize distribute machine learning scheme, namely split federated learning (SFL), to boost the development of VEI. We present a novel adaptive and parellel SFL scheme and conduct corresponding analysis on its performance. Future research directions are highlighted to shed light on the efficient design of SFL.*

- **[Adaptive and Parallel Split Federated Learning in Vehicular Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18707)**, arxiv, May 2024.
  - *Vehicular edge intelligence (VEI) is a promising paradigm for enabling future intelligent transportation systems by accommodating artificial intelligence (AI) at the vehicular edge computing (VEC) system. Federated learning (FL) stands as one of the fundamental technologies facilitating collaborative model training locally and aggregation, while safeguarding the privacy of vehicle data in VEI. However, traditional FL faces challenges in adapting to vehicle heterogeneity, training large models on resource-constrained vehicles, and remaining susceptible to model weight privacy leakage. Meanwhile, split learning (SL) is proposed as a promising collaborative learning framework which can mitigate the risk of model wights leakage, and release the training workload on vehicles. SL sequentially trains a model between a vehicle and an edge cloud (EC) by dividing the entire model into a vehicle-side model and an EC-side model at a given cut layer. In this work, we combine the advantages of SL and FL to develop an Adaptive Split Federated Learning scheme for Vehicular Edge Computing (ASFV). The ASFV scheme adaptively splits the model and parallelizes the training process, taking into account mobile vehicle selection and resource allocation. Our extensive simulations, conducted on non-independent and identically distributed data, demonstrate that the proposed ASFV solution significantly reduces training latency compared to existing benchmarks, while adapting to network dynamics and vehicles' mobility.*

  - *In this paper, we consider a multi-layer federated edge learning framework where both cloud and edge servers are used for FL and design a Data Importance-aware Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning (DHFL) scheme. We develop a [joint](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/joints-structural-components) data selection and resource allocation algorithm based on data importance to maximize learning efficiency in DHFL.*
